## Current Features

- Real-time preview (Early access).
- Audio & Video time precise seeking.
- Export project.
- Smooth transitions.
- Keyframe editing.
- Lots of properties (Reverse, Speed, Opacity, Temperature, Hue, Saturation, Brightness,...)
- Sharable templates (Beta Early access.).
- Edit raw FFmpeg command (Gen Cmd and you're free to edit whatever you want. Not for normal users as it require FFmpeg command experience).
- Render cross-platform (By saving it as a zip file including the JSON timeline, transfer it to your PC, or other stronger devices, and use it to render the clip, you can easily render across platforms).
- Full control over export parameters (including Constant Rate Factor, Width, Height, Framerate and etc. Allows you to input any value you prefer. Higher settings may take longer to render. The limitations depend on the devices used. Yup, we can render 4k, 8k, 16k or whatever k you want).
- Multitrack editing.
- No watermarks or subscriptions.
- Support both Time-based and Frame-based editing style.
- Profiles and status (Alpla Early access. Avatar and display username.).
- ~~Transactions~~ (Not what you might think! You can upload the template, set the price for people to buy, and earn 80% of the transactions. Purchased templates can be customized however the buyers want. It’s literally their right to own it.).

## Requirements

### Windows / MacOS / Linux

- We are currently working on the Android version, so it isn't available yet.
   
### iOS

- We are currently working on the Android version, so it isn't available yet.

### Android

- Minimum SDK: 24 (Nougat, Android 7.0)
- FFmpeg Support (You can check if your device supports it by opening the app).

And that's actually it! High-end devices render quickly, low-end devices render slowly, but the functionality remains the same!


## Donate

Most open-source projects are nearly non-profitable, which means we rely on your support to survive this harsh reality. Instead of asking for subscriptions — no, we don’t do that here — why not consider donating so the project can develop faster?
